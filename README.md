# Network-Programming
This repo contains the code for a TCP server and a HTTP server
This was code was created during a project on a course on network programming.
The project was on the topic of socket programming.
The project was structured around a series of tasks that were to be completed. Task 1 and Task 2 was focused on the TCP server part and Task 3 and Task 4 was focused on the HTTP sever part.
PS. this repo is only an example since it uses skeleton code that was given and as such is not entierly my own work. This repo will be made private soon
